# TravelPlanner PlanToGo

It is a web application designed to simplify travel planning and organization. It consists of three main components, such as Checklist, Itinerary, and Budget. The main idea is to have all components for the travel related preparation in one place.

The web application was initially developed using NodeJS (CS50FinalProject Repository). Now, it has been redesigned with both frontend (React) and backend (NodeJS). The application also includes adding items to the database (MariaDB/SQL) and managing login information.
